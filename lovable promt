Recreate the website 'https: / / vozesdafeira. framer.website/ single, mobile-first React component using Tailwind CSS.
**1. Overall Goal & Aesthetics:**
* **Format:** Single React component ( App
function).
* **Design:** Fully responsive, mobile-first design, matching the clean layout and structure seen on the reference site
(e.g., stacked sections, full-width images, blue accent bars) •
**Primary Accent Color:** Deep Blue
(#4A75B2) • Use this color for titles, call-to-action text, and accent backgrounds.
* **Language:** All content must be in Portuguese, using the specific titles and mock text provided below.
**2. Crucial Feature: Interactive P5.js
Header Animation**
The header must feature a dynamic P5.js canvas. The animation should display a particle system with the following behavior:
* **Initial State:** Particles are randomly diffused across the canvas.
* **Interaction:** Upon clicking or tapping the canvas, the particles should smoothly *re-organize* to form a recognizable shape (e.g., the title text
'Vozes da Feira' or a simple logo shape) •
* **Toggle:** Subsequent clicks/taps should switch the particles back and forth between the organized shape and the diffused random state.
* **Implementation:** The P5.js library must be loaded externally via a <script>
tag, and the
managed within a React ssebtecto
should be hook.
The canvas height should be approximately
- 40vh•

34 curtidas"). | Cards
should be visually separated and mobile-friendly. |

* Include a simple top-right navigation menu/toggle with links for **Histórias**,
**Quem Somos**, and **Fórum**.
